# ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰The Vaccine Uptake Prediction
## STEP 1: Business understanding
### Business Overview
A vaccine is a medical tool that helps the body build immunity against diseases. Vaccines not only protect individuals but also protect communities through herd immunity, where enough people are immunized to reduce the overall spread of disease.

There are different types of vaccines, such as the seasonal flu vaccine (for common flu strains) and the H1N1 vaccine (for swine flu). These play a key role in preventing large outbreaks and saving lives.

In 2009, the world faced a pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza virus (swine flu), which led to an estimated 151,000â€“575,000 deaths globally in its first year. A vaccine for H1N1 was introduced in October 2009. Shortly after, the U.S. National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey was conducted to measure who received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines.

The survey also collected information on peopleâ€™s demographics, health status, behaviors, and opinions. Studying this data helps us understand why some groups chose vaccination while others did not, and provides guidance for future public health efforts.

### Problem Statement
Although vaccines like the seasonal flu and H1N1 were available in 2009, uptake was low, especially for H1N1. This reflects vaccine hesitancy, which weakens herd immunity and increases disease risk.

The key challenge is to understand the factors influencing vaccination decisionsâ€”such as demographics, health beliefs, or doctor recommendationsâ€”and to build predictive models. These insights can help identify hesitant groups and support better public health strategies in future pandemics.

### Business Objectives
#### Main Objective
To build a predictive model that identifies the key factors influencing H1N1 flu vaccine uptake, to understand patterns of vaccine hesitancy, and provide insights that can guide future public health communication and decision-making.

#### Specific Objectives (NB// focused on H1N1 vaccine)
1.  To analyse the effect of demographic factors(i.e., age,education,income) on vaccine uptake.
2. To analyse the effect of opinions and beliefs (e.g., vaccine effectiveness, risk perceptions, safety concerns)on vaccine uptake.
3. To investigate the influence of health status and behaviours(e.g., chronic conditions, mask use, handwashing) in influencing vaccination uptake.
4. To investigate the influence of Doctor's recommendations and a health worker in influencing vaccination uptake.
#### Research Questions
1. How do demographic factors affect influence H1N1 vaccine uptake?
2. How do perceptions of vaccine effectiveness, risk of illness, and safety concerns affect H1N1 vaccination decisions uptake?
3. Do people with chronic medical conditions or protective behaviors (e.g., mask use, handwashing) show higher H1N1 vaccination uptake?
4. Does receiving a doctorâ€™s recommendation or being a health worker increase the likelihood of getting the H1N1 vaccine?
#### Success Criteria
##### Business success criteria:
* Gain a clear understanding of H1N1 vaccine uptake patterns across different features.
* Identify key factors that influence vaccine decisions.
* Provide insights that can guide public health communication strategies to reduce vaccine hesitancy.
##### Data success criteria:
* Perform thorough EDA with at least 10 meaningful visualizations that answer the research questions.
* Build at least two classification models to predict H1N1 vaccine uptake.
* Identify and rank the most important features influencing H1N1 vaccination.
* Ensure results are interpretable and clearly communicated for both technical and non-technical audiences.
